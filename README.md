# Design-and-Implementation-of-a-Secure-Company-Network-System

## Overview

This project focuses on designing and implementing a secure corporate network system. It incorporates best practices in network design, security measures, and incident response to ensure high availability, security, and efficient operation of the network.

### Key Objectives:
- Build a scalable and secure network topology.
- Implement defense-in-depth security strategies.
- Enhance network monitoring and response capabilities.

## Tools Used
- **Cisco Packet Tracer**: For network simulation and topology design.
- **Fortinet FortiGate**: For advanced security measures including firewall and VPN configurations.
- **Wireshark**: For traffic analysis and troubleshooting.

## Features

### 1. Network Topology
- Design includes a headquarters and two branch offices.
- VLANs are configured for department isolation.

### 2. Security Design
- **Physical Security**: Controlled access to server rooms.
- **Technical Security**: Firewalls, IDS/IPS, and encrypted VPNs.
- **Administrative Security**: Security policies and user training programs.

### 3. Incident Response, Disaster Recovery, and Business Continuity (IR, DR & BC)
- Detailed plans for handling incidents and ensuring minimal disruption to business operations.

### 4. Monitoring and Control
- SOC tools for real-time network monitoring, log analysis, and user behavior tracking.

### 5. AAA Server Implementation
- Ensures secure **Authentication**, **Authorization**, and **Accounting** of network users.

### 6. Awareness and Training
- Regular user training programs to minimize human error and improve security awareness.


## How to Run
1. Open the `Project.pkt` file in Cisco Packet Tracer.
2. Follow the instructions in the presentation slides for testing security measures.
3. Use the FortiGate configuration guide for advanced security setups.
